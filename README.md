CSS and asset files for the Net Ninja YouTube nodejs playlist

The final project code can be found in the public/assests folder of this repo

If you have been following the tutorial, code for each and every lesson is added in the Practice folder so you can directly download and check.
All files have been tested.

If more files for  .\Practice\ should be added. They will be added very soon.

code was implemented but there were some errors:
the script for todo-list.js couldn't be found in todo.ejs so i had to copy-paste the code  directly
into todo.ejs

the same is true for the styles.css file.
the update request works but it adds every item twice. delete also deletes every item twice.
